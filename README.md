💼 HR Analytics Dashboard in Power BI
🚀 Excited to share my latest Power BI project — an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard that provides a deep dive into employee attrition trends!
📊 Key Highlights:
Analyzed a dataset of 1470 employees with an attrition rate of 16.1%
Identified key attrition trends by age group, education, job role, sales slab, and years at company
Used Power Query for data cleaning, DAX for custom measures, and data modeling for efficient relationships and slicers
🔍 The dashboard offers:
Clear KPIs like overall attrition, average salary, and average tenure
Dynamic filtering across departments and gender
Actionable insights, such as high attrition in the 26–35 age group and sales under 5K
🛠️ Tech Stack: Power BI | Power Query | DAX | Data Modeling | Visualization
This project helped sharpen my skills in turning raw HR data into insightful, decision-ready visuals.
